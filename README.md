# Framework Engineering Collaborative Learning

This repo introduces the Framework Engineering Collaborative Learning program from the [Prescription Free Academy of Web Development and Software Engineering](https://prescriptionfree.academy/).

It includes general information and documentation relating to the program, along with links to individual project repos.

Resources that apply to the program can go here. It’s not intended for code, but could be used in future for  scripts that relate to the program in general.

It’s the starting point if you’re looking for something.

## Where to Start

Create a simple library to help with updating the DOM. Try it out with different use cases and see how well it performs. Be creative and see what works.

Do this before you get in to looking at any of the solutions crafted by other students (easy right now - there are none).

Iterate on your design and the features of your library. Keep going over it and introducing new features or improving what’s there so it works consistently or more effectively.

Think about effective naming that clearly delineates what it does. Write documentation of the interface and how it works.

Find your own approach or at least innovate as much as you can. Nigel can help with this. Be creative and imagine what could be possible to make it all easier and more intuitive when working with your library to create software.

## Research

These are links that can be useful research as you get in to the heart of what this is about.
